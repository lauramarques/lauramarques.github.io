# Laura MarquÃ©s

I am a data scientist and a researcher in ecology and climate science.

I have been working at the University of Bern, at the [Geocomputation and Earth Observation group](https://geco-group.org/) with Prof. Benjamin D. Stocker. My most recent position was Margarita Salas Fellow at the University of Bern and in collaboration with the [Cambium Research Group](https://www.cambiumresearch.eu/) at the University of Valladolid, Spain. I had previously been a postdoc at the [Department of Environmental Systems Science](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

I received my PhD in Forest Ecology at the department of [Life Sciences](https://www.uah.es/es/conoce-la-uah/campus-centros-y-departamentos/departamentos/Ciencias-de-la-Vida/) at the University of AlcalÃ¡, Spain.
