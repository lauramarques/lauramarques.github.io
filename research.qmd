## Research

My research have focused on evaluating the impacts of global change on forest ecosystems from a multiscale perspective. 
My approach includes the use of diverse data in combination with process-based modeling and statistical analyses. 

## Data Science
I use R for data management, visualization, and modeling. My workflow includes handling large datasets while ensuring data integrity and reproducibility. I create visualizations to explore trends and communicate findings and apply statistical and computational modeling techniques to extract insights from complex data.
